Alpha Update:

This update allows you to upload any length of audio files, as long as it's over 12 seconds. No splitting necessary anymore! But it may be glitchy, please test it and report any errors here: https://github.com/PhoenixStormJr/Tortoise-tts-fast-longer/issues. :)

I use this mainly for RVC, when I don't have much audio, this can generate extra.

# Future
I'm going to test the alpha version. Then I will also add an option to record your own voice.
